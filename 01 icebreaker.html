    <p>I'm working on my computer progaming bachlors. I like playing video games. I'm not married. I work at deseret industries. I like how convienent BYU is. It will assist in my knowledge of programming and I hope to know more of how websites work. It's been seventeen years since I was baptised and I haven't picked a favorite quote or scripture.</p>
